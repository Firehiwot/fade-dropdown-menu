### Usage

A common usage would be having the dropdown appear over other elements on your site. The example given here doesn't technically include this, but it isn't hard to add.
All you need to do is make sure that the submenu ULs have a higher z-index than the element you want it appear over. If you want it to be above everything else on your page, simply give the submenu ULs a z-index of, say, 1000.

### IE Compatibility

In the form it's given in, this will only display properly on IE8+ (as long as you declare a doctype, which you should, anyway).

If you remove the CSS arrows, this will work on IE6+.
