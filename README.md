CSS Dropdown 1
========================

This is the first of a few CSS dropdown menus I've made. It's semantic, entirely CSS, and has some neat features like fade in and out. To view it live, head over to

### IE Compatibility

In the form it's given in, this will only display properly on IE8+ (as long as you declare a doctype, which you should, anyway).

If you remove the CSS arrows, this will work on IE6+.
